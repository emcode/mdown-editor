Really Simple Markdown Editor Experiment
====================

This is just one of my js experiments - wysiwym live editor - same concept as example editor included in [showdown project](https://github.com/guybrush/showdown) . It is really simple application created with backbone.js library.

Run it
---------------------

You can see this experiment in action [on this page](http://emcode.github.com/mdown-editor/editor.html).

Dependencies
---------------------

To run this you need to drop the following files - included at the bottom of editor.html source - in **js/vendor** folder or switch to **gh-pages** branch.

*  [showdown.js](https://github.com/guybrush/showdown) - markdown to HTML converter  written in JS by John Fraser
*  [jquery-1.7.2.js](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) - used here mainly for selecting elements on html page (laziness)
*  [undercore-1.3.3.js](https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/) - dependency of backbone.js (JS utility functions)
*  [backbone-0.9.3.js](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone) - fancy JS micro-framework
